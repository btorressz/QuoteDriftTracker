# ðŸ“ˆ Quote Drift Tracker

## ðŸ§  Overview

**Quote Drift Tracker** is a Python-based application designed to analyze MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and HFT (High-Frequency Trading) dynamics on the Solana blockchain through Jupiter DEX quote monitoring.  
The application continuously monitors Jupiter DEX quote latency and price drift to identify potential front-running opportunities and trading inefficiencies.

It operates by making concurrent API requests to Jupiterâ€™s quote endpoint, tracking response times, price movements, and calculating statistical metrics to detect patterns that could indicate MEV opportunities.
